Libraries are included for ubuntu linux
in the main folder.

Install by going to /src
chmod +x INSTALL
./INSTALL configure_install

Make sure you have the required libraries
and the precompiled binary in the main
folder may work for you. Sorry for no
proper Cmake, this was really just a
learning experience for myself.
